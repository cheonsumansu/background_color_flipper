## repo :: background_color_flipper
hi, this is a repo about background color flipper for practicing javascript. I made it by referring [this video](https://youtu.be/3PHXvlpOkf4?t=426).

- change the color by clicking the button.

- it has two modes, simple and hex.

  > in simple mode, it will show 5 colors randomly after you click the button.
  
  > in hex mode, it will show random hex-code color after you click the button.
